        Often, the body paragraph demonstrates and develops your topic sentence
        through an ordered, logical progression of ideas. There are a number of
        useful techniques for expanding on topic sentences and developing your
        ideas in a paragraph. Illustration in a paragraph supports a general
        statement by means of examples, details, or relevant quotations (with
        your comments). In Harry’s world fate works not only through powers and
        objects such as prophecies, the Sorting Hat, wands, and the Goblet of
        Fire, but also through people. Repeatedly, other characters decide
        Harry’s future for him, depriving him of freedom and choice. For
        example, before his eleventh birthday, the Dursleys control Harry’s
        life, keeping from him knowledge of his past and understanding of his
        identity (Sorcerer’s 49). In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,
        Dobby repeatedly assumes control over events by intercepting Ron’s and
        Hermione’s letters during the summer; by sealing the barrier to Platform
        93⁄4, causing Harry to miss the Hogwarts Express; and by sending a
        Bludger after Harry in a Quidditch match, breaking his wrist. Yet again,
        in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, many adults intercede while
        attempting to protect Harry from perceived danger, as Snape observes:
        “Everyone from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep
        famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black” (284). All these characters,
        as enactors of fate, unknowingly drive Harry toward his destiny by
        attempting to control or to direct his life, while themselves controlled
        and directed by fate. —Julia Pond, “A Story of the Exceptional: Fate and
        Free Will in the Harry Potter Series” The definition paragraph does
        exactly what you would expect: it defines a term, often by drawing
        distinctions between the term and other related ones. The definition
        that you provide will often be specific to your subject area. Try to
        avoid perfunctory dictionary definitions that do not inform your
        analysis in a meaningful way. Our typology is built on three dimensions:
        internality, types of participants, and the degree of effective
        resistance. For our study, a civil war is any armed conflict that
        involves (a) military action internal to the metropole, (b) the active
        participation of the national government, and (c) effective resistance
        by both sides. With these criteria, we differentiate civil wars from
        other types of internal violent conflicts. —Melvin Small and J. David
        Singer, Resort to Arms: International and Civil Wars, 1816–1980 The
        analysis or classification paragraph develops a topic by distinguishing
        its component parts and discussing each of these parts separately.
        Policies of privatisation should be considered as responses to several
        distinct pressures. First, privatisation is a response by the state to
        internal forces such as increasing fiscal problems (O’Connor, 1973). It
        provides a means of lessening the state’s fiscal responsibilities by
        encouraging the development of private alternatives which, theoretically
        at least, do not draw upon the state’s financial reserves. Second, the
        promotion of private sector activity is a response to pressures
        originating ‘outside’ the state apparatus. These include demands from
        people who see a large state bureaucracy as inefficient and wasteful,
        demands from business interests who claim that they can overcome these
        inefficiencies, and pressures from client groups who seek to reduce
        their dependency on the welfare state by having more control over the
        services on which they depend. Clearly, this variety of calls for
        privatisation means that it is not a process with a uniform outcome;
        there exists a correspondingly wide variety of forms of privatisation.
        —Adapted from Glenda Laws, “Privatisation and the Local Welfare State” A
        comparison or a contrast paragraph zeroes in on a key similarity or
        difference between, for instance, two sources, positions, or ideas.
        Decide whether to deal only with similarities or only with differences,
        or to cover both. Also, keep in mind that a single comparison can be
        spread out over two separate paragraphs. As the following topic sentence
        indicates, you should make your intention clear to readers from the
        outset. Evidence from industrialized countries suggests that compared
        with older men, older women more often experience functional impairments
        and activity limitations, have longer durations of disability, and spend
        proportionately more remaining years of life disabled. —Kathryn M.
        Yount, “Differences in Disability among Older Women in Egypt and
        Tunisia”
